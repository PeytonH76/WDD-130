            <h2>Positives</h2>
            <h3>A Positive</h3>
            <p>There are plenty of positives with having a child with down syndrome along with a few cons too.
                One of the positives is that you yourself will grow so much as a person.  You will gain patience,
                become more compassionate, start enjoying the small simple things, and become a advocate for those in need.
                When you have a down syndrome child you start to become more humble and kind do others, and as a result you will
                become more happier.
            </p>
            <h3>A Positive</h3>

            </div>            
            <p>Down syndrome kids tend to not have an ego, and because of that they are more compassionate and have 
                more empathy.  Down syndrome kids go through anger emotions and all that stuff but when they get back to 
                being calm they forget what they were upset with and forgive you or whoever almost right away.

            <h2>Negatives</h2>
            <h3>A Negative</h3>
            <div class="positives_card2">
                <img class="positives_img_card2" src="images/pexelsantonishkraba.jpg" alt="Woman Holding Hands with Down Syndrome Girl">
            </div>
            <p>A negative about having a down syndrome child is the fact that they may have a lot of 
                health problems.  Some of these are respiratory infections, heart defects, thyroid disorders, etc.
                Parents may have to do a lot of surgeries and check ups and procedures.  That isn't the harderest 
                part though, the hardest part is seeing the hardships your child is going through and dealing with that 
                heartache.  But you can get through it, it'll be worth it. 
            </p>

        <div class="negatives_info2">
            <h3>A Negative</h3>
            <p>Another negative would be that it can cause anxiety on the parents in social 
                situations.  Your child may have breakdowns in public and others accidents may happen
                as well.  You may feel that others are judging you and that they may not treat you well. 
                But again as with the other negative above, it's all worth it and you'll be able to handle it.
