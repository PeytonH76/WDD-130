            <p>Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition in which a nucleus in a cell has an extra 
                pair of chromosomes instead of the normal 23 pairs of chromosomes.  Down syndrome occurs when 
                a person has an extra copy or partial copy of chromosome 21.  Researchers don't know much about 
                why down syndrome occurs, but they say that there is a higher chance of having a down syndrome baby if 
                the women is pregnant at 35 years or older.  Thisn't isn't as big of a factor since most pregnancies 
                occur before that.

            <h2>Physicals</h2>
            <p>Some common physical appearances for down syndrome children include things such as
                a flattened face, especially the bridge of the nose, eyes that slant up 
                and are almond shaped, a short neck, small ears, poor muscle tone or loose joints, shorter in height
                small hands and feet and a few others.  These are most of the main physical features, and all of these don't 
                always occur in downsyndrome kids, but it's most likely to happen.

            <p>In the long term having a down syndrome child is going to survive up to 20 years 88%
                of the time.  As your down syndrome child gets older, be prepared to most likely have them
                living in your house for the rest of their life or your life.  Down syndrome people ,even though they may
                be slower, do have skills and can work, they may need small simple jobs, but they can work.
