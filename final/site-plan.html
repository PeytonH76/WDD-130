      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I plan to teach everyone the not very well knons of down syndrome. What if you had a child that ends up
        having down syndrome, would you like it if all you saw were pages talking about the negatives of down syndrome
        instead of positives? This site will help people realize the positives of down syndrome and how it isn't bad 
        like most people make it out to be.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This is mainly intended for parents who find out that their kid will have down syndrome. But I think 
        anyone will benefit from this.

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will be not as long and as big, but it will have general stuff, and sayings like 
        “How would you like it if you found out your child will have down syndrome and you did research to just find all the negatives of it?”.  
        There will be pictures that will add some non-boring stuff to the page that way it is more entertaining for the user to look at.  
        There may also be a hover affect on those pictures and a shadow.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Positives and Negatives</h3>
      <p>
        So the first page is going to be about the positives and “negatives” of 
        down syndrome.  This will include two sections one being positives and 
        the other negatives and in each of those sections there will be smaller subtitles that 
        will talk about a word or phrase and so on.

      </ul>
      <h3>Science Behind Down Synrome</h3>
      <p>
        The second page consist of the science and there will also be different titles talking about different things along with some pictures.  
        There will be titles that will talk about how this occurred and another on the why.  
        I can't think of anything else right now but those two or guaranteed to be on the second page.  
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Page 3</p>
